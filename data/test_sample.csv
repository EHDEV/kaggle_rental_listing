It's a pre-war, doorman, spacious, 2 bedroom and the Murray Hill neighborhood is terrific. You should without doubt schedule a viewing ASAP. The apartment's features include views of the skyline. There's a den for extra living space. Take note that the rental is a convertible, which means there's enough room to create an extra room/privacy for someone else or for just added privacy. The apt has onsite laundry. You might never need it with New York's abundant order-in options, but the kitchen features granite countertops and hardwood floors. You'll find an electric oven. The bedroom has hardwood flooring. You should have no problem fitting a queen in the bedroom. And includes a balcony in the room. This is a great opportunity to rent in a building that's rarely available. It's worth noting there's a gym and a 24-hour doorman.
